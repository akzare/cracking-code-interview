    "#### Steps\n",
    "1. **Find the End of the Left Subsequence**:\n",
    "   * Traverse the array from left to right to find the end of the left sorted subsequence.\n",
    "   * This is done by finding the first element that is greater than the next element.\n",
    "   * For example, in the array [1, 2, 4, 7, 10, 11, 7, 12, 6, 7, 16, 18, 19], the end of the left subsequence is at index 5 (11).\n",
    "2. **Find the Start of the Right Subsequence**:\n",
    "   * Traverse the array from right to left to find the start of the right sorted subsequence.\n",
    "   * This is done by finding the first element that is less than the previous element.\n",
    "   * For example, in the array [1, 2, 4, 7, 10, 11, 7, 12, 6, 7, 16, 18, 19], the start of the right subsequence is at index 6 (7).\n",
    "3. **Find the Minimum and Maximum in the Unsorted Subsequence**:\n",
    "   * Identify the minimum and maximum values within the unsorted sequence (between the end of the left subsequence and the start of the right subsequence).\n",
    "   * In the array [1, 2, 4, 7, 10, 11, 7, 12, 6, 7, 16, 18, 19], the unsorted subsequence is [7, 12, 6, 7].\n",
    "   * The minimum value is 6 and the maximum value is 12.\n",
    "4. **Adjust the Left Index**:\n",
    "   * Traverse the left part of the array to adjust the left index to include any values greater than the minimum of the unsorted sequence.\n",
    "   * In the example array, the adjusted left index is 3.\n",
    "5. **Adjust the Right Index**:\n",
    "   * Traverse the right part of the array to adjust the right index to include any values less than the maximum of the unsorted sequence.\n",
    "   * In the example array, the adjusted right index is 9.\n",
